Superstore Dashboard
📋 Project Overview
In today's competitive market, businesses must make data-driven decisions to stay ahead. This project is dedicated to helping a Superstore Giant identify key insights about their operations, including products, regions, categories, and customer segments to target or avoid. By leveraging the power of Power BI, I have developed an interactive and visually engaging dashboard to aid strategic decision-making.
